# USB-HID-Volume-Knob
In this Project I built a volume knob that controls your pc directly instead of your audio output

Editors note: I don't advise anyone to use a small case like mine because you can screw up very easily in confined spaces like this

Hardware Used:
- Seeeduino Xiao / pro micro
- usb cable
- pc
- small can (sold as empty makeup container)
- Knob (in my case a 3D printed adaptor from a bottle cap to D-Shaft)
- Rotary encoder
- Wires


Software Used:
- Arduino IDE
- Fusion 360
